Hallo! Using iD in OpenStreetMap I only found attributes etc. in english. 
Is it possible to define different languages in iD so each user can select, which one he/she wants to use?
Example: I had to learn to use "allotments" to create a garden named "Kleingartenanlage" in german OpenStreetMap...
Thanks Kaipedia
