# Addresses

Addresses are some of the most useful information for the map.

Although addresses are often represented as parts of streets, in OpenStreetMap
they're recorded as attributes of buildings and places along streets.

You can add address information to places mapped as building outlines as well
as well as those mapped as single points. The optimal source of address
data is from an on-the-ground survey or personal knowledge - as with any
other feature, copying from commercial sources like Google Maps is strictly
forbidden.
