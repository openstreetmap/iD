# Imagery

Aerial imagery is an important resource for mapping. A combination of
airplane flyovers, satellite views, and freely-compiled sources are available
in the editor under the 'Background Settings' menu on the left.

By default a [Bing Maps](http://www.bing.com/maps/) satellite layer is
presented in the editor, but as you pan and zoom the map to new geographical
areas, new sources will become available. Some countries, like the United
States, France, and Denmark have very high-resolution, high-quality imagery
available for smaller geographical coverages.

Imagery is sometimes offset from the map data because of a mistake on the
imagery provider's side - so if you see many roads shifted from the background,
don't immediately go to move them all. You can set an offset for imagery
by clicking 'Fix alignment' at the bottom of the bottom of the Background
Settings UI.
