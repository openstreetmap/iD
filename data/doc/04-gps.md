# GPS

GPS data is the most trusted source of data for OpenStreetMap. This editor
supports local traces - `.gpx` files on your local computer. You can collect
this kind of GPS trace with a number of smartphone applications as well as
personal GPS hardware.

For information on how to perform a GPS survey, read
[Surveying with a GPS](http://learnosm.org/en/beginner/using-gps/).

To use a GPX track for mapping, drag and drop the GPX file onto the map map
editor. If it's recognized, it will be added to the map as a bright green
line. Click on the 'Background Settings' menu on the left side to enable,
disable, or zoom to this new GPX-powered layer.

The GPX track isn't directly uploaded to OpenStreetMap - the best way to
use it is to draw on the map, using it as a guide for the new features that
you add.
