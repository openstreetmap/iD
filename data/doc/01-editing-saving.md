# Editing & Saving

This editor is designed to work primarily online, and you're accessing
it through a website right now.

### Selecting Features

To select a map feature, like a road or point of interest, click
on it on the map. This will highlight the selected feature, open a panel with
details about it, and show a menu of things you can do with the feature.

Multiple features can be selected by holding the 'Shift' key, clicking,
and dragging on the map. This will select all features within the box
that's drawn, allowing you to do things with several features at once.

### Saving Edits

When you make changes like editing roads, buildings, and places, these are
stored locally until you save them to the server. Don't worry if you make
a mistake - you can undo changes by clicking the undo button, and redo
changes by clicking the redo button.

Click 'Save' to finish a group of edits - for instance, if you've completed
an area of town and would like to start on a new area. You'll have a chance
to review what you've done, and the editor supplies helpful suggestions
and warnings if something doesn't seem right about the changes.

If everything looks good, you can enter a short comment explaining the change
you made, and click 'Save' again to post the changes
to [OpenStreetMap.org](http://www.openstreetmap.org/), where they are visible
to all other users and available for others to build and improve upon.

If you can't finish your edits in one sitting, you can leave the editor
window and come back (on the same browser and computer), and the
editor application will offer to restore your work.
