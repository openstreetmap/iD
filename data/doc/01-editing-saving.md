# Editing & Saving

This editor is designed to work primarily online, and you're accessing
it through a website right now.

When you create changes, like editing roads, buildings, and places, these are
stored locally until you save them to the server. Don't worry if you make
a mistake - you can undo changes by clicking the undo button, and redo
changes by clicking the redo button.

Click 'Save' to finish a group of edits - for instance, if you've completed
an area of town and would like to start on a new area. You'll have a chance
to review what you've done, and the editor supplies helpful suggestions
and warnings if something doesn't seem right about the changes.

Clicking 'Save' again, on the new dialog, will post the changes
to [OpenStreetMap.org](http://www.openstreetmap.org/), where they are visible
to all other users and available for others to build and improve upon.

If you can't finish your edits in one sitting, you can leave the editor
window and come back (on the same browser and computer), and the
editor application will offer to restore your work.
