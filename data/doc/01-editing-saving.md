# Editing & Saving

This editor is designed to work primarily online, and you're accessing
it through a website right now.

## Selecting Features

To select a map feature, like a road or point of interest, simply single-click
on it on the map. This will highlight the selected feature, show a panel of
details, and also show a menu of things you can do with the feature.

Multiple features can be selected by holding the 'Shift' key, clicking,
and dragging on the map. This will select all features within the box
that's drawn, and you can do certain 'batch operations' on all features.

## Saving Edits

When you create changes, like editing roads, buildings, and places, these are
stored locally until you save them to the server. Don't worry if you make
a mistake - you can undo changes by clicking the undo button, and redo
changes by clicking the redo button.

Click 'Save' to finish a group of edits - for instance, if you've completed
an area of town and would like to start on a new area. You'll have a chance
to review what you've done, and the editor supplies helpful suggestions
and warnings if something doesn't seem right about the changes.

Clicking 'Save' again, on the new dialog, will post the changes
to [OpenStreetMap.org](http://www.openstreetmap.org/), where they are visible
to all other users and available for others to build and improve upon.

If you can't finish your edits in one sitting, you can leave the editor
window and come back (on the same browser and computer), and the
editor application will offer to restore your work.
