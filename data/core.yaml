      details about it, and show a menu of things you can do with the feature.

      To select multiple features, hold down the 'Shift' key. Then either click
      on the features you want to select, or drag on the map to draw a rectangle.
      This will draw a box and select all the points within it.

      ### Saving Edits

      When you make changes like editing roads, buildings, and places, these are
      stored locally until you save them to the server. Don't worry if you make
      a mistake - you can undo changes by clicking the undo button, and redo
      changes by clicking the redo button.

      Click 'Save' to finish a group of edits - for instance, if you've completed
      an area of town and would like to start on a new area. You'll have a chance
      to review what you've done, and the editor supplies helpful suggestions
      and warnings if something doesn't seem right about the changes.

      If everything looks good, you can enter a short comment explaining the change
      you made, and click 'Save' again to post the changes
      to [OpenStreetMap.org](http://www.openstreetmap.org/), where they are visible
      to all other users and available for others to build and improve upon.

      If you can't finish your edits in one sitting, you can leave the editor
      window and come back (on the same browser and computer), and the
      editor application will offer to restore your work.

      ### Using the editor

      You can view a list of keyboard shortcuts by pressing the `?` key.

    roads: |
      # Roads

      You can create, fix, and delete roads with this editor. Roads can be all
      kinds: paths, highways, trails, cycleways, and more - any often-crossed
      segment should be mappable.

      ### Selecting

      Click on a road to select it. An outline should become visible, along
      with a small tools menu on the map and a sidebar showing more information
      about the road.

      ### Modifying

      Often you'll see roads that aren't aligned to the imagery behind them
      or to a GPS track. You can adjust these roads so they are in the correct
      place.

      First click on the road you want to change. This will highlight it and show
      control points along it that you can drag to better locations. If
      you want to add new control points for more detail, double-click a part
      of the road without a node, and one will be added.

      If the road connects to another road, but doesn't properly connect on
      the map, you can drag one of its control points onto the other road in
      order to join them. Having roads connect is important for the map
      and essential for providing driving directions.

      You can also click the 'Move' tool or press the `M` shortcut key to move the entire road at
      one time, and then click again to save that movement.

      ### Deleting

      If a road is entirely incorrect - you can see that it doesn't exist in satellite
      imagery and ideally have confirmed locally that it's not present - you can delete
      it, which removes it from the map. Be cautious when deleting features -
      like any other edit, the results are seen by everyone and satellite imagery
      is often out of date, so the road could simply be newly built.

      You can delete a road by clicking on it to select it, then clicking the
      trash can icon or pressing the 'Delete' key.

      ### Creating

      Found somewhere there should be a road but there isn't? Click the 'Line'
      icon in the top-left of the editor or press the shortcut key `2` to start drawing
      a line.

      Click on the start of the road on the map to start drawing. If the road
      branches off from an existing road, start by clicking on the place where they connect.

      Then click on points along the road so that it follows the right path, according
      to satellite imagery or GPS. If the road you are drawing crosses another road, connect
      it by clicking on the intersection point. When you're done drawing, double-click
      or press 'Return' or 'Enter' on your keyboard.
    gps: |
      # GPS

      Collected GPS traces are one valuable source of data for OpenStreetMap. This editor
      supports local traces - `.gpx` files on your local computer. You can collect
      this kind of GPS trace with a number of smartphone applications as well as
      personal GPS hardware.

      For information on how to perform a GPS survey, read
      [Mapping with a smartphone, GPS, or paper](http://learnosm.org/en/mobile-mapping/).

      To use a GPX track for mapping, drag and drop the GPX file onto the map
      editor. If it's recognized, it will be added to the map as a bright purple
      line. Click on the 'Map Data' menu on the right side to enable,
      disable, or zoom to this new GPX-powered layer.

      The GPX track isn't directly uploaded to OpenStreetMap - the best way to
      use it is to draw on the map, using it as a guide for the new features that
      you add, and also to [upload it to OpenStreetMap](http://www.openstreetmap.org/trace/create)
      for other users to use.
    imagery: |
      # Imagery

      Aerial imagery is an important resource for mapping. A combination of
      airplane flyovers, satellite views, and freely-compiled sources are available
      in the editor under the 'Background Settings' menu on the right.

      By default a [Bing Maps](http://www.bing.com/maps/) satellite layer is
      presented in the editor, but as you pan and zoom the map to new geographical
      areas, new sources will become available. Some countries, like the United
      States, France, and Denmark have very high-quality imagery available for some areas.

      Imagery is sometimes offset from the map data because of a mistake on the
      imagery provider's side. If you see a lot of roads shifted from the background,
      don't immediately move them all to match the background. Instead you can adjust
      the imagery so that it matches the existing data by clicking 'Fix alignment' at
      the bottom of the Background Settings UI.
    addresses: |
      # Addresses

      Addresses are some of the most useful information for the map.

      Although addresses are often represented as parts of streets, in OpenStreetMap
      they're recorded as attributes of buildings and places along streets.

      You can add address information to places mapped as building outlines
      as well as those mapped as single points. The optimal source of address
      data is from an on-the-ground survey or personal knowledge - as with any
      other feature, copying from commercial sources like Google Maps is strictly
      forbidden.
    inspector: |
      # Using the Inspector

      The inspector is the section on the left side of the page that allows you to
      edit the details of the selected feature.

      ### Selecting a Feature Type

      After you add a point, line, or area, you can choose what type of feature it
      is, like whether it's a highway or residential road, supermarket or cafe.
      The inspector will display buttons for common feature types, and you can
      find others by typing what you're looking for in the search box.

      Click the 'i' in the bottom-right-hand corner of a feature type button to
      learn more about it. Click a button to choose that type.

      ### Using Forms and Editing Tags

      After you choose a feature type, or when you select a feature that already
      has a type assigned, the inspector will display fields with details about
      the feature like its name and address.

      Below the fields you see, you can click the 'Add field' dropdown to add
      other details, like a Wikipedia link, wheelchair access, and more.

      At the bottom of the inspector, click 'Additional tags' to add arbitrary
      other tags to the element. [Taginfo](http://taginfo.openstreetmap.org/) is a
      great resource for learn more about popular tag combinations.

      Changes you make in the inspector are automatically applied to the map.
      You can undo them at any time by clicking the 'Undo' button.
    buildings: |
      # Buildings

      OpenStreetMap is the world's largest database of buildings. You can create
      and improve this database.

      ### Selecting

      You can select a building by clicking on its border. This will highlight the
      building and open a small tools menu and a sidebar showing more information
      about the building.

      ### Modifying

      Sometimes buildings are incorrectly placed or have incorrect tags.

      To move an entire building, select it, then click the 'Move' tool. Move your
      mouse to shift the building, and click when it's correctly placed.

      To fix the specific shape of a building, click and drag the nodes that form
      its border into better places.

      ### Creating

      One of the main questions around adding buildings to the map is that
      OpenStreetMap records buildings both as shapes and points. The rule of thumb
      is to _map a building as a shape whenever possible_, and map companies, homes,
      amenities, and other things that operate out of buildings as points placed
      within the building shape.

      Start drawing a building as a shape by clicking the 'Area' button in the top
      left of the interface, and end it either by pressing 'Return' on your keyboard
      or clicking on the first node drawn to close the shape.

      ### Deleting

      If a building is entirely incorrect - you can see that it doesn't exist in satellite
      imagery and ideally have confirmed locally that it's not present - you can delete
      it, which removes it from the map. Be cautious when deleting features -
      like any other edit, the results are seen by everyone and satellite imagery
      is often out of date, so the building could simply be newly built.

      You can delete a building by clicking on it to select it, then clicking the
      trash can icon or pressing the 'Delete' key.
    relations: |
      # Relations

      A relation is a special type of feature in OpenStreetMap that groups together
      other features. For example, two common types of relations are *route relations*,
      which group together sections of road that belong to a specific freeway or
      highway, and *multipolygons*, which group together several lines that define
      a complex area (one with several pieces or holes in it like a donut).

      The group of features in a relation are called *members*. In the sidebar, you can
      see which relations a feature is a member of, and click on a relation there
      to select the it. When the relation is selected, you can see all of its
      members listed in the sidebar and highlighted on the map.

      For the most part, iD will take care of maintaining relations automatically
      while you edit. The main thing you should be aware of is that if you delete a
      section of road to redraw it more accurately, you should make sure that the
      new section is a member of the same relations as the original.

      ## Editing Relations

      If you want to edit relations, here are the basics.

      To add a feature to a relation, select the feature, click the "+" button in the
      "All relations" section of the sidebar, and select or type the name of the relation.

      To create a new relation, select the first feature that should be a member,
      click the "+" button in the "All relations" section, and select "New relation...".

      To remove a feature from a relation, select the feature and click the trash
      button next to the relation you want to remove it from.

      You can create multipolygons with holes using the "Merge" tool. Draw two areas (inner
      and outer), hold the Shift key and click on each of them to select them both, and then
      click the "Merge" (+) button.
