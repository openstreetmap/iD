      move_line_connected: "Lines that are connected to other features will stay connected as you move the line to a new location. iD may prevent you from moving a line across another connected line."
      delete_line_h: "Deleting Lines"
      delete_line: "If a line is entirely incorrect, for example a road that doesn't exist in the real world, it's OK to delete it. Be careful when deleting features: the background imagery you are using might be outdated, and a road that looks wrong could simply be newly built."
      delete_line_command: "To delete a line, {rightclick} right-click on the line to select it and show the edit menu, then use the {delete} **Delete** command."
    areas:
      title: Areas

      point_or_area_h: "Points or Areas?"
      point_or_area: "Many features can be represented as points or areas. You should map buildings and property outlines as areas whenever possible. Place points inside a building area to represent businesses, amenities, and other features located inside the building."
      add_area_h: "Adding Areas"
      add_area_command: "To add an area, click the {area} **Area** button on the toolbar above the map, or press the shortcut key `3`. This will change the mouse cursor to a cross symbol."
      add_area_draw: "Next, position the mouse cursor at one of the corners of the feature and {leftclick} left-click or press `Space` to begin placing nodes around the outer edge of the area. Continue placing more nodes by clicking or pressing `Space`. While drawing, you can zoom in or drag the map in order to add more detail."
      add_area_finish: "To finish an area, press `{return}` or click again on either the first or last node."
      square_area_h: "Square Corners"
      square_area_command: "Many area features like buildings have square corners. To square the corners of an area, {rightclick} right-click the edge of the area and select the {orthogonalize} **Square** command from the editing menu."
      modify_area_h: "Modifying Areas"
      modify_area_dragnode: "Often you'll see areas that aren't shaped correctly, for example a building that does not match up with the background imagery. To adjust the shape of an area, first {leftclick} left-click to select it. All nodes of the area will be drawn as small circles. You can then drag the nodes to better locations."
      modify_area_addnode: "You can also create new nodes along an area either by {leftclick}**x2** double-clicking on the edge of the area or by dragging the small triangles at the midpoints between nodes."
      delete_area_h: "Deleting Areas"
      delete_area: "If an area is entirely incorrect, for example a building that doesn't exist in the real world, it's OK to delete it. Be cautious when deleting features - the background imagery you are using might be outdated, and a building that looks wrong could simply be newly built."
      delete_area_command: "To delete an area, {rightclick} right-click on the area to select it and show the edit menu, then use the {delete} **Delete** command."
    relations:
      title: Relations
      intro: "A *relation* is a special type of feature in OpenStreetMap that groups together other features. The features that belong to a relation are called *members*, and each member can have a *role* in the relation."
      edit_relation_h: "Editing Relations"
      edit_relation: "At the bottom of the feature editor, you can expand the \"Relations\" section to see if the selected feature is a member of any relations. You can then click on the relation to select and edit it."
      edit_relation_add: "To add a feature to a relation, select the feature, then click the {plus} add button in the \"Relations\" section of the feature editor. You can choose from a list of nearby relations, or choose the \"New relation...\" option."
      edit_relation_delete: "You can also click the {delete} **Delete** button to remove the selected feature from the relation. If you remove all of the members from a relation, the relation will be deleted automatically."
      maintain_relation_h: "Maintaining Relations"
      maintain_relation: "For the most part, iD will maintain relations automatically as you edit. You should take care when replacing features that might be members of relations. For example if you delete a section of road and draw a new section of road to replace it, you should add the new section to the same relations (routes, turn restrictions, etc.) as the original."
      relation_types_h: "Relation Types"
      multipolygon_h: "Multipolygons"
      multipolygon: "A *multipolygon* relation is a group of one or more *outer* features and one or more inner features. The outer features define the outer edges of the multipolygon, and the inner features define sub-areas or holes cut out from the inside of the multipolygon."
      multipolygon_create: "To create a multipolygon, for example a building with a hole in it, draw the outer edge as an area and the inner edge as a line or different kind of area. Then `{shift}`+{leftclick} left-click to select both features, {rightclick} right-click to show the edit menu, and select the {merge} **Merge** command."
      multipolygon_merge: "Merging several lines or areas will create a new multipolygon relation with all selected areas as members. iD will choose the inner and outer roles automatically, based on which features are contained inside other features."
      turn_restriction_h: "Turn restrictions"
      turn_restriction: "A *turn restriction* relation is a group of several road segments in an intersection. Turn restrictions consist of a *from* road, *via* node or roads, and a *to* road."
      turn_restriction_field: "To edit turn restrictions, select a junction node where two or more roads meet. The feature editor will display a special \"Turn Restrictions\" field containing a model of the intersection."
      turn_restriction_editing: "In the \"Turn Restrictions\" field, click to select a \"from\" road, and see whether turns are allowed or restricted to any of the \"to\" roads. You can click on the turn icons to toggle them between allowed and restricted. iD will create relations automatically and set the from, via, and to roles based on your choices."
      route_h: "Routes"
      route: "A *route* relation is a group of one or more line features that together form a route network, like a bus route, train route, or highway route."
      route_add: "To add a feature to a route relation, select the feature and scroll down to the \"Relations\" section of the feature editor, then click the {plus} add button to add this feature to a nearby existing relation or a new relation."
      boundary_h: "Boundaries"
      boundary: "A *boundary* relation is a group of one or more line features that together form an administrative boundary."

      add_note_h: "Adding Notes"
      add_note: "To add a new note, click the {note} **Note** button on the toolbar above the map, or press the shortcut key `4`. This will change the mouse cursor to a cross symbol. To place the new note on the map, position the mouse cursor where the note should go, then {leftclick} left-click or press `Space`."
      move_note: "Only new notes can be moved. To move a note, place the mouse cursor over the new note, then press and hold the {leftclick} left mouse button while dragging the note to its new location."
      update_note_h: "Closing, Reopening, and Commenting"
      update_note: "An existing note can be updated by closing it, reopening it, or adding a comment to it. Closing a note indicates that the problem has been resolved. Reopening a note indicates that the original issue is not resolved."

    imagery:
      title: Background Imagery
      intro: "The background imagery that appears beneath the map data is an important resource for mapping. This imagery can be aerial photos collected from satellites, airplanes, and drones, or it can be scanned historical maps or other freely available source data."
      sources_h: "Imagery Sources"
      choosing: "To see which imagery sources are available for editing, click the {layers} **Background settings** button on the side of the map."
      sources: "By default, a [Bing Maps](https://www.bing.com/maps/) satellite layer is chosen as the background image. Depending on where you are editing, other imagery sources will be available. Some may be newer or have higher resolution, so it is always useful to check and see which layer is the best one to use as a mapping reference."
      offsets_h: "Adjusting Imagery Offset"
      offset: "Imagery is sometimes offset slightly from accurate map data. If you see a lot of roads or buildings shifted from the background imagery, it may be the imagery that's incorrect, so don't move them all to match the background. Instead, you can adjust the background so that it matches the existing data by expanding the \"Adjust Imagery Offset\" section at the bottom of the Background Settings pane."
      offset_change: "Click on the small triangles to adjust the imagery offset in small steps, or hold the {leftclick} left mouse button and drag within the gray square to slide the imagery into alignment."
    streetlevel:
      title: Street Level Photos
      intro: "Street level photos are useful for mapping traffic signs, businesses, and other details that you can't see from satellite and aerial images. The iD editor supports street level photos from [Bing Streetside](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/maps/streetside), [Mapillary](https://www.mapillary.com), and [OpenStreetCam](https://www.openstreetcam.org)."
      using_h: "Using Street Level Photos"
      using: "To use street level photos for mapping, click the {data} **Map data** panel on the side of the map to enable or disable the available photo layers."
      photos: "When enabled, the photo layer displays a line along the sequence of photos. At higher zoom levels, a circle marks at each photo location, and at even higher zoom levels, a cone indicates the direction the camera was facing when the photo was taken."
      viewer: "When you click on one of the photo locations, a photo viewer appears in the bottom corner of the map. The photo viewer contains controls to step forward and backward in the image sequence. It also shows the username of the person who captured the image, the date it was captured, and a link to view the image on the original site."
    gps:
      title: GPS Traces
      intro: "Collected GPS traces are a valuable source of data for OpenStreetMap. This editor supports *.gpx*, *.geojson*, and *.kml* files on your local computer. You can collect GPS traces with a smartphone, sports watch, or other GPS device."
      survey: "For information on how to perform a GPS survey, read [Mapping with a smartphone, GPS, or paper](http://learnosm.org/en/mobile-mapping/)."
      using_h: "Using GPS Traces"
      using: "To use a GPS trace for mapping, drag and drop the data file onto the map editor. If it's recognized, it will be drawn on the map as a bright purple line. Click the {data} **Map data** panel on the side of the map to enable, disable, or zoom to your GPS data."
      tracing: "The GPS track isn't sent to OpenStreetMap - the best way to use it is to draw on the map, using it as a guide for the new features that you add."
      upload: "You can also [upload your GPS data to OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/trace/create) for other users to use."
    qa:
      title: Quality Assurance
      intro: "*Quality Assurance* (Q/A) tools can find improper tags, disconnected roads, and other issues with OpenStreetMap, which mappers can then fix. To view existing Q/A issues, click the {data} **Map data** panel to enable a specific Q/A layer."
      tools_h: "Tools"
      tools: "The following tools are currently supported: [KeepRight](https://www.keepright.at/), [ImproveOSM](https://improveosm.org/en/) and [Osmose](https://osmose.openstreetmap.fr/)."

          about: "This field allows you to inspect and modify turn restrictions. It displays a model of the selected intersection including other nearby connected roads."
          from_via_to: "A turn restriction always contains: one **FROM way**, one **TO way**, and either one **VIA node** or one or more **VIA ways**."
          maxdist: "The \"{distField}\" slider controls how far to search for additional connected roads."
          maxvia: "The \"{viaField}\" slider adjusts how many via ways may be included in the search. (Tip: simple is better)"

          title: Tips
          simple: "**Prefer simple restrictions over complex ones.**"
          simple_example: "For example, avoid creating a via-way restriction if a simpler via-node turn restriction will do."
          indirect: "**Some restrictions display the text \"(indirect)\" and are drawn lighter.**"
          indirect_example: "These restrictions exist because of another nearby restriction. For example, an \"Only Straight On\" restriction will indirectly create \"No Turn\" restrictions for all other paths through the intersection."
          indirect_noedit: "You may not edit indirect restrictions. Instead, edit the nearby direct restriction."

      title: "Welcome"
      welcome: "Welcome! This walkthrough will teach you the basics of editing on OpenStreetMap."
      practice: "All of the data in this walkthrough is just for practicing, and any edits that you make in the walkthrough will not be saved."
      words: "This walkthrough will introduce some new words and concepts. When we introduce a new word, we'll use *italics*."
      mouse: "You can use any input device to edit the map, but this walkthrough assumes you have a mouse with left and right buttons. **If you want to attach a mouse, do so now, then click OK.**"
      leftclick: "When this tutorial asks you to click or double-click, we mean with the left button. On a trackpad it might be a single-click or single-finger tap. **Left-click {num} times.**"
      rightclick: "Sometimes we'll also ask you to right-click. This might be the same as control-click, or two-finger tap on a trackpad. Your keyboard might even have a 'menu' key that works like right-click. **Right-click {num} times.**"
      chapters: "So far, so good! You can use the buttons below to skip chapters at any time or to restart a chapter if you get stuck. Let's begin! **Click '{next}' to continue.**"
