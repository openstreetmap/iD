      modify_line_h: "Modifying Lines"
      modify_line_dragnode: "Often you'll see lines that aren't shaped correctly, for example a road that does not match up with the background imagery. To adjust the shape of a line, first {leftclick} left-click to select it. All nodes of the line will be drawn as small circles. You can then drag the nodes to better locations."
      modify_line_addnode: "You can also create new nodes along a line either by {leftclick}**x2** double-clicking on the line or by dragging the small triangles at the midpoints between nodes."
      connect_line_h: "Connecting Lines"
      connect_line: "Having roads connected properly is important for the map and essential for providing driving directions."
      connect_line_display: "The connections between roads are drawn with gray circles. The endpoints of a line are drawn with larger white circles if they don't connect to anything."
      connect_line_drag: "To connect a line to another feature, drag one of the line's nodes onto the other feature until both features snap together. Tip: You can hold down the `{alt}` key to prevent nodes from connecting to other features."

      maintain_relation_h: "Maintaining Relations"
      maintain_relation: "For the most part, iD will maintain relations automatically as you edit. You should take care when replacing features that might be members of relations. For example if you delete a section of road and draw a new section of road to replace it, you should add the new section to the same relations (routes, turn restrictions, etc.) as the original."
      relation_types_h: "Relation Types"
      multipolygon_h: "Multipolygons"
      multipolygon: "A *multipolygon* relation is a group of one or more *outer* features and one or more inner features. The outer features define the outer edges of the multipolygon, and the inner features define sub-areas or holes cut out from the inside of the multipolygon."
      multipolygon_create: "To create a multipolygon, for example a building with a hole in it, draw the outer edge as an area and the inner edge as a line or different kind of area. Then `{shift}`+{leftclick} left-click to select both features, {rightclick} right-click to show the edit menu, and select the {merge} **Merge** command."
      multipolygon_merge: "Merging several lines or areas will create a new multipolygon relation with all selected areas as members. iD will choose the inner and outer roles automatically, based on which features are contained inside other features."
      turn_restriction_h: "Turn restrictions"
      turn_restriction: "A *turn restriction* relation is a group of several road segments in an intersection. Turn restrictions consist of a *from* road, *via* node or roads, and a *to* road."
      turn_restriction_field: "To edit turn restrictions, select a junction node where two or more roads meet. The feature editor will display a special \"Turn Restrictions\" field containing a model of the intersection."
      turn_restriction_editing: "In the \"Turn Restrictions\" field, click to select a \"from\" road, and see whether turns are allowed or restricted to any of the \"to\" roads. You can click on the turn icons to toggle them between allowed and restricted. iD will create relations automatically and set the from, via, and to roles based on your choices."
      route_h: "Routes"
      route: "A *route* relation is a group of one or more line features that together form a route network, like a bus route, train route, or highway route."
      route_add: "To add a feature to a route relation, select the feature and scroll down to the \"All relations\" section of the feature editor, then click the {plus} add button to add this feature to a nearby existing relation or a new relation."

To place the new note on the map, position the mouse cursor where the note should go, then {leftclick} left-click or press `Space`."
      move_note: "Only new notes can be moved. To move a note, place the mouse cursor over the new note, then press and hold the {leftclick} left mouse button while dragging the note to its new location."
      update_note_h: "Closing, Reopening, and Commenting"
      update_note: "An existing note can be updated by closing it, reopening it, or adding a comment to it. Closing a note indicates that the problem has been resolved. Reopening a note indicates that the original issue is not resolved."
      save_note_h: "Saving Notes"
      save_note: "You must save any note edits individually by clicking the buttons below the note comments. Note edits are **not** included in changesets that you upload to OpenStreetMap."
    imagery:
      title: Background Imagery
      intro: "The background imagery that appears beneath the map data is an important resource for mapping. This imagery can be aerial photos collected from satellites, airplanes, and drones, or it can be scanned historical maps or other freely available source data."
      sources_h: "Imagery Sources"
      choosing: "To see which imagery sources are available for editing, click the {layers} **Background settings** button on the side of the map."
      sources: "By default, a [Bing Maps](https://www.bing.com/maps/) satellite layer is chosen as the background image. Depending on where you are editing, other imagery sources will be available. Some may be newer or have higher resolution, so it is always useful to check and see which layer is the best one to use as a mapping reference."
      offsets_h: "Adjusting Imagery Offset"
      offset: "Imagery is sometimes offset slightly from accurate map data. If you see a lot of roads or buildings shifted from the background imagery, it may be the imagery that's incorrect, so don't move them all to match the background. Instead, you can adjust the background so that it matches the existing data by expanding the \"Adjust Imagery Offset\" section at the bottom of the Background Settings pane."
      offset_change: "Click on the small triangles to adjust the imagery offset in small steps, or hold the left mouse button and drag within the gray square to slide the imagery into alignment."
    streetlevel:
      title: Street Level Photos
      intro: "Street level photos are useful for mapping traffic signs, businesses, and other details that you can't see from satellite and aerial images. The iD editor supports street level photos from [Bing Streetside](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/maps/streetside), [Mapillary](https://www.mapillary.com), and [OpenStreetCam](https://www.openstreetcam.org)."
      using_h: "Using Street Level Photos"
      using: "To use street level photos for mapping, click the {data} **Map data** panel on the side of the map to enable or disable the available photo layers."
      photos: "When enabled, the photo layer displays a line along the sequence of photos. At higher zoom levels, a circle marks at each photo location, and at even higher zoom levels, a cone indicates the direction the camera was facing when the photo was taken."
      viewer: "When you click on one of the photo locations, a photo viewer appears in the bottom corner of the map. The photo viewer contains controls to step forward and backward in the image sequence. It also shows the username of the person who captured the image, the date it was captured, and a link to view the image on the original site."
    gps:
      title: GPS Traces
      intro: "Collected GPS traces are a valuable source of data for OpenStreetMap. This editor supports *.gpx*, *.geojson*, and *.kml* files on your local computer. You can collect GPS traces with a smartphone, sports watch, or other GPS device."
      survey: "For information on how to perform a GPS survey, read [Mapping with a smartphone, GPS, or paper](http://learnosm.org/en/mobile-mapping/)."
      using_h: "Using GPS Traces"
      using: "To use a GPS trace for mapping, drag and drop the data file onto the map editor. If it's recognized, it will be drawn on the map as a bright purple line. Click the {data} **Map data** panel on the side of the map to enable, disable, or zoom to your GPS data."
      tracing: "The GPS track isn't sent to OpenStreetMap - the best way to use it is to draw on the map, using it as a guide for the new features that you add."
      upload: "You can also [upload your GPS data to OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/trace/create) for other users to use."
    qa:
      title: Quality Assurance
      intro: "*Quality Assurance* (Q/A) 3rd party tools help lead to better quality of OSM data. They list automatically deteted bugs, conflics, and issues with the data, which mappers can then go and fix. To view existing Q/A issues, click the {data} **Map data** panel to enable a specific Q/A layer."
      tools_h: "Tools"
      tools: "The following tools are currently supported: [KeepRight](https://www.keepright.at/). Expect iD to support [Osmose](https://osmose.openstreetmap.fr/), [ImproveOSM](https://improveosm.org/en/), and more Q/A tools in the future."
      issues_h: "Handling Issues"
      issues: "Handling Q/A issues is similar to handling notes. Clicking an existing Q/A issue populates the sidebar with details on the issue type and related features. Each tool has its own capabilities, but generally you can comment and/or close an issue. Expect iD to support a 'fix me' button to automatically fix simple issues in the future."

          simple: "**Prefer simple restrictions over complex ones.**"
          simple_example: "For example, avoid creating a via-way restriction if a simpler via-node turn restriction will do."
          indirect: "**Some restrictions display the text \"(indirect)\" and are drawn lighter.**"
          indirect_example: "These restrictions exist because of another nearby restriction. For example, an \"Only Straight On\" restriction will indirectly create \"No Turn\" restrictions for all other paths through the intersection."

      words: "This walkthrough will introduce some new words and concepts. When we introduce a new word, we'll use *italics*."
      mouse: "You can use any input device to edit the map, but this walkthrough assumes you have a mouse with left and right buttons. **If you want to attach a mouse, do so now, then click OK.**"
      leftclick: "When this tutorial asks you to click or double-click, we mean with the left button. On a trackpad it might be a single-click or single-finger tap. **Left-click {num} times.**"
      rightclick: "Sometimes we'll also ask you to right-click. This might be the same as control-click, or two-finger tap on a trackpad. Your keyboard might even have a 'menu' key that works like right-click. **Right-click {num} times.**"
