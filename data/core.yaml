      maintain_relation_h: "Maintaining Relations"
      maintain_relation: "For the most part, iD will maintain relations automatically as you edit. You should take care when replacing features that might be members of relations. For example if you delete a section of road and draw a new section of road to replace it, you should add the new section to the same relations (routes, turn restrictions, etc.) as the original."
      relation_types_h: "Relation Types"
      multipolygon_h: "Multipolygons"
      multipolygon: "A *multipolygon* relation is a group of one or more *outer* features and one or more inner features. The outer features define the outer edges of the multipolygon, and the inner features define sub-areas or holes cut out from the inside of the multipolygon."
      multipolygon_create: "To create a multipolygon, for example a building with a hole in it, draw the outer edge as an area and the inner edge as a line or different kind of area.

      choosing: "To see which imagery sources are available for editing, open the {layers_icon} **{background_settings}** panel on the side of the map."
      sources: "The [Bing Maps](https://www.bing.com/maps/) satellite layer or the best local imagery is set as the default background. Depending on where you are editing, multiple imagery sources are available. Some may be newer or have higher resolution, so it is always useful to check and see which layer is the best one to use as a mapping reference."
      offsets_h: "Adjusting Imagery Offset"
      offset: "Imagery is sometimes offset slightly from accurate map data. If you see a lot of roads or buildings shifted from the background imagery, it may be the imagery that's incorrect, so don't move them all to match the background. Instead, you can adjust the background so that it matches the existing data by expanding the \"{imagery_offset}\" section at the bottom of the Background Settings pane."
      offset_change: "Press the small triangle buttons to adjust the imagery offset in small steps, or hold the {leftclick} left mouse button and drag within the gray square to slide the imagery into alignment."
