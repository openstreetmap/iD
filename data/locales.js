In order to make an edit, you'll need a\n[free OpenStreetMap account](https://www.openstreetmap.org/user/new).\n\nThe [iD editor](http://ideditor.com/) is a collaborative project with [source\ncode available on GitHub](https://github.com/systemed/iD).\n",
        "editing_saving": "# Editing & Saving\n\nThis editor is designed to work primarily online, and you're accessing\nit through a website right now.\n\n### Selecting Features\n\nTo select a map feature, like a road or point of interest, click\non it on the map. This will highlight the selected feature, open a panel with\ndetails about it, and show a menu of things you can do with the feature.\n\nMultiple features can be selected by holding the 'Shift' key, clicking,\nand dragging on the map. This will select all features within the box\nthat's drawn, allowing you to do things with several features at once.\n\n### Saving Edits\n\nWhen you make changes like editing roads, buildings, and places, these are\nstored locally until you save them to the server. Don't worry if you make\na mistake - you can undo changes by clicking the undo button, and redo\nchanges by clicking the redo button.\n\nClick 'Save' to finish a group of edits - for instance, if you've completed\nan area of town and would like to start on a new area. You'll have a chance\nto review what you've done, and the editor supplies helpful suggestions\nand warnings if something doesn't seem right about the changes.\n\nIf everything looks good, you can enter a short comment explaining the change\nyou made, and click 'Save' again to post the changes\nto [OpenStreetMap.org](http://www.openstreetmap.org/), where they are visible\nto all other users and available for others to build and improve upon.\n\nIf you can't finish your edits in one sitting, you can leave the editor\nwindow and come back (on the same browser and computer), and the\neditor application will offer to restore your work.\n",
        "roads": "# Roads\n\nYou can create, fix, and delete roads with this editor. Roads can be all\nkinds: paths, highways, trails, cycleways, and more - any often-crossed\nsegment should be mappable.\n\n### Selecting\n\nClick on a road to select it. An outline should become visible, along\nwith a small tools menu on the map and a sidebar showing more information\nabout the road.\n\n### Modifying\n\nOften you'll see roads that aren't aligned to the imagery behind them\nor to a GPS track. You can adjust these roads so they are in the correct\nplace.\n\nFirst click on the road you want to change. This will highlight it and show\ncontrol points along it that you can drag to better locations. If\nyou want to add new control points for more detail, double-click a part\nof the road without a point, and one will be added.\n\nIf the road connects to another road, but doesn't properly connect on\nthe map, you can drag one of its control points onto the other road in\norder to join them. Having roads connect is important for the map\nand essential for providing driving directions.\n\nYou can also click the 'Move' tool or press the `M` shortcut key to move the entire road at\none time, and then click again to save that movement.\n\n### Deleting\n\nIf a road is entirely incorrect - you can see that it doesn't exist in satellite\nimagery and ideally have confirmed locally that it's not present - you can delete\nit, which removes it from the map. Be cautious when deleting features -\nlike any other edit, the results are seen by everyone and satellite imagery\nis often out of date, so the road could simply be newly built.\n\nYou can delete a road by clicking on it to select it, then clicking the\ntrash can icon or pressing the 'Delete' key.\n\n### Creating\n\nFound somewhere there should be a road but there isn't? Click the 'Line'\nicon in the top-left of the editor or press the shortcut key `2` to start drawing\na line.\n\nClick on the start of the road on the map to start drawing. If the road\nbranches off from an existing road, start by clicking on the place where they connect.\n\nThen click on points along the road so that it follows the right path, according\nto satellite imagery or GPS. If the road you are drawing crosses another road, connect\nit by clicking on the intersection point. When you're done drawing, double-click\nor press 'Return' or 'Enter' on your keyboard.\n",

If it's recognized, it will be added to the map as a bright green\nline. Click on the 'Background Settings' menu on the left side to enable,\ndisable, or zoom to this new GPX-powered layer.\n\nThe GPX track isn't directly uploaded to OpenStreetMap - the best way to\nuse it is to draw on the map, using it as a guide for the new features that\nyou add.\n",

A combination of\nairplane flyovers, satellite views, and freely-compiled sources are available\nin the editor under the 'Background Settings' menu on the left.\n\nBy default a [Bing Maps](http://www.bing.com/maps/) satellite layer is\npresented in the editor, but as you pan and zoom the map to new geographical\nareas, new sources will become available. Some countries, like the United\nStates, France, and Denmark have very high-quality imagery available for some areas.\n\nImagery is sometimes offset from the map data because of a mistake on the\nimagery provider's side. If you see a lot of roads shifted from the background,\ndon't immediately move them all to match the background. Instead you can adjust\nthe imagery so that it matches the existing data by clicking 'Fix alignment' at\nthe bottom of the Background Settings UI.\n",
        "addresses": "# Addresses\n\nAddresses are some of the most useful information for the map.\n\nAlthough addresses are often represented as parts of streets, in OpenStreetMap\nthey're recorded as attributes of buildings and places along streets.\n\nYou can add address information to places mapped as building outlines as well\nas well as those mapped as single points. The optimal source of address\ndata is from an on-the-ground survey or personal knowledge - as with any\nother feature, copying from commercial sources like Google Maps is strictly\nforbidden.\n",
        "inspector": "# Using the Inspector\n\nThe inspector is the user interface element on the right-hand side of the\npage that appears when a feature is selected and allows you to edit its details.\n\n### Selecting a Feature Type\n\nAfter you add a point, line, or area, you can choose what type of feature it\nis, like whether it's a highway or residential road, supermarket or cafe.\nThe inspector will display buttons for common feature types, and you can\nfind others by typing what you're looking for in the search box.\n\nClick the 'i' in the bottom-right-hand corner of a feature type button to\nlearn more about it. Click a button to choose that type.\n\n### Using Forms and Editing Tags\n\nAfter you choose a feature type, or when you select a feature that already\nhas a type assigned, the inspector will display fields with details about\nthe feature like its name and address.\n\nBelow the fields you see, you can click icons to add other details,\nlike [Wikipedia](http://www.wikipedia.org/) information, wheelchair\naccess, and more.\n\nAt the bottom of the inspector, click 'Additional tags' to add arbitrary\nother tags to the element. [Taginfo](http://taginfo.openstreetmap.org/) is a\ngreat resource for learn more about popular tag combinations.\n\nChanges you make in the inspector are automatically applied to the map.\nYou can undo them at any time by clicking the 'Undo' button.\n\n### Closing the Inspector\n\nYou can close the inspector by clicking the close button in the top-right,\npressing the 'Escape' key, or clicking on the map.\n",

This will highlight the\nbuilding and open a small tools menu and a sidebar showing more information\nabout the building.\n\n### Modifying\n\nSometimes buildings are incorrectly placed or have incorrect tags.\n\nTo move an entire building, select it, then click the 'Move' tool. Move your\nmouse to shift the building, and click when it's correctly placed.\n\nTo fix the specific shape of a building, click and drag the points that form\nits border into better places.\n\n### Creating\n\nOne of the main questions around adding buildings to the map is that\nOpenStreetMap records buildings both as shapes and points. The rule of thumb\nis to _map a building as a shape whenever possible_, and map companies, homes,\namenities, and other things that operate out of buildings as points placed\nwithin the building shape.\n\nStart drawing a building as a shape by clicking the 'Area' button in the top\nleft of the interface, and end it either by pressing 'Return' on your keyboard\nor clicking on the first point drawn to close the shape.\n\n### Deleting\n\nIf a building is entirely incorrect - you can see that it doesn't exist in satellite\nimagery and ideally have confirmed locally that it's not present - you can delete\nit, which removes it from the map. Be cautious when deleting features -\nlike any other edit, the results are seen by everyone and satellite imagery\nis often out of date, so the road could simply be newly built.\n\nYou can delete a building by clicking on it to select it, then clicking the\ntrash can icon or pressing the 'Delete' key.\n"

S pomocí editoru můžete přidávat a upravovat data v mapě třeba ve svém okolí, a zlepšovat tak celou mapu pro každého.\n\nVaše úpravy mapy budou viditelné každým, kdo používá OpenStreetMap. Je ovšem třeba mít uživatelský účet na OpenStreetMap, který si můžete [snadno a zdarma zřídit](https://www.openstreetmap.org/user/new).\n\n[iD editor](http://ideditor.com/) je projekt vytvářený spoluprácí více lidí, se [zdrojovým kódem na GitHubu](https://github.com/systemed/iD).\n",

Objekt se takto označí, otevře se boční panel s vlastnostmi objektu a zobrazí se nabídka akcemi, které lze s objektem provést.\n\nMůžete označit a pracovat s několika objekty najednou: podržte klávesu 'Shift', klikněte na mapu a táhněte myší či prstem. Takto se označí všechny objekty uvnitř příslušného obdélníku - a můžete pracovat se všemi najednou.\n\n### Publikace změn\n\nKdyž provedete nějaké úpravy objektů v mapě, úpravy jsou uloženy lokálně ve vašem prohlížeči. Nebojte se, když uděláte chybu - úpravy lze vrátit zpět tlačítkem Zpět, a naopak je znovu provést tlačítkem Znovu.\n\nPo dokončení bloku úprav klikněte na 'Uložit' - například když jste upravili jednu část města, a chcete začít úpravy někde jinde. Zobrazí se přehled úprav, které jste provedli, editor tyto úpravy zkontroluje, a když se mu něco nebude zdát, zobrazí varování a návrhy.\n\nKdyž bude všechno v pořádku, můžete přidat krátký komentář s vysvětlením vašich úprav a kliknout znovu 'Uložit'. Úpravy se tímto publikují na [OpenStreetMap.org](http://www.openstreetmap.org/), kde za chvíli budou viditelné pro všechny uživatele a bude na nich možné provádět další úpravy.\n\nPokud nechcete nebo nemůžete pravy dokončit teď, stačí prostě odejít ze stránky pryč. Až příště navštívíte stránku (na stejném počítači, ve stejném prohlížeči), editor vám nabídne možnost znovu načíst neuložené úpravy.\n"

Om een aanpassing te maken, heb je een ⏎ [gratis OpenStreetMap account](https://www.openstreetmap.org/user/new) nodig.⏎ ⏎ De [iD editor](http://ideditor.com/) is een samenwerkingsproject waarvan de [broncode ⏎ beschikbaar is op GitHub](https://github.com/systemed/iD).⏎\n",
        "editing_saving": "# Aanpassen & Opslaan⏎ ⏎ Deze editor is in de eerste plaats gemaakt om online te functioneren, en je benadert ⏎ het op dit moment via een website.⏎ ⏎ ### Objecten Selecteren⏎ ⏎ Om een kaartobject te selecteren, zoals een weg of een restaurant, klik⏎ erop op de kaart. Het geselecteerde object zal oplichten, een schermpje opent zich met⏎ informatie en een menu wordt getoond met dingen die je met het object kan doen.⏎ ⏎ Meerdere objecten kunnen worden geselecteerd door de 'Shift' knop ingedrukt te houden, en tegelijk op de kaart⏎ te klikken en te slepen. Hierdoor worden alle objecten binnen het vak⏎ dat wordt getekend, zodat je aanpassingen kan doen op meerdere objecten tegelijk.⏎ ⏎ ### Aanpassingen opslaan⏎ ⏎ Wanneer je veranderingen maakt zoals aanpassingen aan wegen, gebouwen, en locaties, worden deze⏎ lokaal opgeslagen tot je ze naar de server verstuurt. Het geeft niet als je een fout⏎ maakt: je kan aanpassingen ongedaan maken door op de knop 'Ongedaan maken' te klikken en aanpassingen⏎ opnieuw te doen door op de knop 'Opnieuw toepassen' te klikken.⏎ ⏎ Klik 'Opslaan' om een groep aanpassingen te voltooien - bijvoorbeeld als je een gebied⏎ van een woonplaats hebt afgerond en je in een nieuw gebied wilt beginnen. Je krijgt de mogelijkheid⏎ om je aanpassingen te bekijken en de editor biedt handige suggesties⏎ en waarschuwingen als er iets niet lijkt te kloppen aan de aanpassingen.⏎ ⏎ Als alles er goed uitziet, kan je een korte notitie invoeren om je aanpassingen toe te lichten⏎ en klik opnieuw op 'Bewaar' om de aanpassingen te verzenden⏎ naar [OpenStreetMap.org](http://www.openstreetmap.org/), waar ze zichtbaar zijn⏎ voor alle andere gebruikers en beschikbaar voor anderen om op voort te bouwen.⏎ ⏎ Als je je aanpassingen niet in één sessie kan afronden, dan kan je de het scherm van de⏎ editor verlaten en terugkeren (met dezelfde browser en computer), en de⏎ editor zal je vragen of je je aanpassingen weer wilt gebruiken.⏎\n",

Wegen zijn er in allerlei soorten en ⏎ maten: landweggetjes, snelwegen, paadjes, fietspaden en veel meer - ieder stukje dat ⏎ vaak wordt gebruikt kan in kaart worden gebracht.⏎⏎ ### Selecteren⏎⏎ Klik op een weg om deze te selecteren. De omtrek verschijnt samen⏎ met een klein menu op de kaart en een schermpje met informatie⏎ over de weg.⏎⏎ ### Aanpassen⏎⏎ Vaak kom je wegen tegen, die niet precies over het beeldmateriaal of de GPS-route⏎ erachter lopen. Je kan deze wegen aanpassen, zodat ze op de juiste plek komen te liggen.⏎⏎ Klik eerst op de weg die je wilt aanpassen. Deze zal dan oplichten en er verschijnen⏎ puntjes langs de lijn die je kan verslepen naar een betere plek.⏎ Als je nieuwe puntjes wilt toevoegen voor meer detaillering, dubbelklik op een weggedeelte⏎ zonder een puntje en een nieuwe wordt toegevoegd.⏎⏎ Als een weg is verbonden met een andere weg, maar niet in de kaart ⏎ dan versleep je een van de puntjes op de andere weg om⏎ ze te verbinden. Dat wegen met elkaar zijn verbonden is belangrijk voor de kaart⏎ en essentieel om een routebeschrijving te kunnen maken.⏎⏎ Je kan bovendien het 'Verplaats' gereedschap aanklikken of de 'V' snelkoppeling om de gehele weg in een keer⏎ te verplaatsen en opnieuw aanklikken om deze verplaatsing op te slaan.⏎ ⏎ ### Verwijderen⏎ ⏎ Als een weg helemaal verkeerd is - je ziet dat het niet op het satellietbeeld te⏎ zien is en je hebt idealiter ter plaatse gecontroleerd, dat de weg er niet is - dan kan je het⏎ verwijderen, zodat het van de kaart verdwijnt. Wees voorzichtig met het verwijderen van objecten ⏎ - zoals bij iedere aanpassing is het resultaat voor iedereen zichtbaar en satellietbeelden⏎ zijn vaak verouderd, dus de weg zou gewoon nieuw zijn aangelegd.⏎⏎ Je kan een weg verwijderen door er op te klikken om het te selecteren, waarna je op het⏎ prullebakicoontje drukt of de 'Delete' toets.⏎⏎ ### Maken⏎ ⏎ Heb je ergens een weg gevonden die nog niet op de kaart staat? Klik op het 'Lijn' gereedschap in de linker bovenhoek van de editor of druk op de snelkoppeling '2' om een lijn te tekenen.⏎ ⏎ Klik op het begin van de weg op de kaart en begin te tekenen. Als de weg zich vertakt van de bestaande weg, begin dan op de plek waar ze elkaar kruisen.⏎⏎ Klik dan de punten langs de weg, zodat deze het juiste tracé volgt, volgens⏎ het satellietbeeld of de GPS-route. Als de weg die je aan het tekenen bent een andere weg kruist, verbindt deze⏎ door op het kruispunt te klikken.

Beweeg je muis⏎ om het gebouw te verplaatsen en klik als het op de goede plek staat.⏎ ⏎ Om de vorm van een gebouw te verbeteren klik en versleep je de punten die samen de omtrek vormen naar de juiste plek.⏎ ⏎ ### Toevoegen⏎ ⏎ Een van de onduidelijkheden over het toevoegen van gebouwen is dat⏎  in OpenStreetMap de gebouwen als vlakken en als punten kunnen worden vastgelegd. De vuistregel is ⏎ dat _gebouwen zoveel mogelijk als een vlak worden ingetekend_ en dat bedrijven, woningen en voorzieningen die in die gebouwen zijn gevestigd als punt worden ingetekend⏎  binnen de omtrek.⏎ ⏎ Begin om een gebouw als een vlak in te tekenen door op de knop 'Vlak' te kliken in de linker⏎  bovenhoek van het scherm en beëindig het tekenen door de 'Return' toets in te drukken of door op het eerste, getekende punt te klikken om de omtrek te sluiten.⏎ ⏎  ### Verwijderen⏎ ⏎  Als een gebouw helemaal verkeerd is - je kan zien, dat het niet in het satellietbeeld zichtbaar is⏎  en idealiter heb je ter plekke geconstateerd dat het niet bestaat - dan kan je het verwijderen. Wees voorzichtig bij het verwijderen van objecten⏎  - zoals alle andere aanpassigen, is het resultaat voor iedereen zichtbaar en satellietbeelden⏎  zijn vaak verouderd, dus het gebouw kan simpelweg onlangs zijn opgetrokken.⏎ ⏎ Je kan een gebouw verwijderen door erop te klikken om het te selecteren en dan op het prullebakicoon te klikken of op de 'Delete' toets te drukken.⏎ \n"

Spowoduje to wybór wszystkich obiektów zawartych w narysowanym\nprostokącie, umożliwiając Tobie wykonywanie działań na kilku obiektach naraz.\n\n### Zapisywanie modyfikacji\n\nGdy wprowadzisz zmiany, na przykład przez modyfikacje dróg, budynków i miejsc, są one\nprzechowywane lokalnie aż zapiszesz je na serwerze. Nie martw się, gdy popełnisz błąd - możesz\ncofnąć zmiany przez kliknięcie na przycisk cofnij, i powtórzyć je poprzez kliknięcie na przycisk powtórz.\n\nKliknij 'Zapisz' aby skończyć grupę modyfikacji - na przykład, gdy skończyłeś pewien obszar miasta i\nchcesz zacząć następny. Będziesz miał wtedy szansę przejrzeć, co zrobiłeś, a edytor dostarczy pomocne\nsugestie i ostrzeżenia w razie, gdyby coś było nie tak z twoimi zmianami.\n\nJeśli wszystko dobrze wygląda, możesz podać krótki komentarz opisujący zmianę, którą wprowadziłeś\ni kliknąć 'Zapisz' ponownie, aby wysłać zmiany do [OpenStreetMap.org](http://www.openstreetmap.org/),\ngdzie będą one widoczne dla wszystkich użytkowników i dostępne dla innych do bazowania na nich i\ndalszego ulepszania.\n\nJeżeli nie możesz skończyć swoich modyfikacji w czasie jednej sesji, możesz opuścić okno edytora i\nwrócić później (na tym samym komputerze i tą samą przeglądarką), a edytor zaoferuje Ci przywrócenie\ntwojej pracy.\n",

Drogi mogą być wszelkiego rodzaju:\nścieżki, ulice, szlaki, ścieżki rowerowe i tak dalej - każdy często uczęszczany odcinek powinien dać się\nprzedstawić\n\n### Zaznaczanie\n\nKliknij na drogę, aby ją zaznaczyć. Obwiednia powinna stać się widoczna, wraz z małym menu\nnarzędziowym na mapie oraz panelem bocznym pokazującym więcej informacji na temat drogi.\n\n### Modyfikowanie\n\nCzęsto będziesz widział drogi, które nie są wyrównane ze zdjęciami satelitarnymi lub śladami GPS.\nMożesz dopasować te drogi tak, aby były we właściwym miejscu.\n\nNajpierw kliknij na drogę, którą chcesz zmienić. Podświetli to ją oraz pokaże punkty kontrolne wdłuż\njej, które możesz przesunąć w lepsze miejsce. Jeżeli chcesz dodać nowe punkty kontrolne, aby droga\nbyła bardziej szczegółowa, dwukrotnie kliknij na części drogi bez punktu, a w tym miejscu nowy się\npojawi.\n\nJeżeli droga łączy się z inną drogą, ale nie jest prawidłowo połączona z nią na mapie, możesz\nprzeciągnąć jeden z puntów kontrolnych na drugą drogę w celu ich połączenia. Prawidłowe połączenia\ndróg są ważne dla mapy i kluczowe dla wyznaczania tras.\n\nMożesz też kliknąć na narzędziu 'Przesuń' lub nacisnąć klawisz `M` aby przesunąć jednocześnie całą\ndrogę, a następnie kliknąć ponownie, aby zachować to przesunięcie.\n\n### Usuwanie\n\nGdy droga jest całkiem błędna - widzisz, że nie istnieje na zdjęciach satelitarnych (a najlepiej sam\nsprawdziłeś w terenie, że jej nie ma) - możesz usunąć ją. Uważaj usuwając obiekty - wyniki usunięcia,\ntak jak każdej modyfikacji, są widoczne dla wszystkich, a zdjęcie satelitarne często nie są aktualne,\nwięc droga może być po prostu nowo wybudowana.\n\nMożesz usunąć drogę przez zaznaczenie jej, a następnie kliknięcie na ikonę kosza lub wciśnięcie\nklawisza 'Delete'.\n\n### Tworzenie\n\nGdzieś tam powinna być droga, ale jej nie ma? Kliknij na przycisk 'Linia' w górnym lewym rogu edytora\nlub naciśnij klawisz `2` na klawiaturze, aby zacząć rysować linię.\n\nKliknij na początku drogi na mapie, aby zacząć rysować. Jeżeli droga odchodzi od już istniejącej, zacznij\nprzez kliknięcie w miejscu, w któreym się łączą.\n\nNastępnie klikaj na punktach wzdłuż drogi tak, aby biegła ona odpowiednio według zdjęć satelitarnych\nlub GPS. Jeżeli droga, którą rysujesz krzyżuje się z inną, połącz je klikając na punkcie przecięcia. Gdy\nskończysz rysować, dwukrotnie kliknij na ostatnim punkcie, lub naciśnij klawisz 'Enter' na klawiaturze.\n",

Jeżeli zostanie\nrozpoznany, zostanie dodany na mapę w postaci jasnozielonej linii. Kliknij na menu 'Ustawienia tła'\npo lewej stronie aby włączyć, wyłączyć lub powiększyć do nowej warstwy GPX.\n\nŚlad GPX nie jest bezpośrednio wysyłany do OpenStreetMap - najlepiej użyć go do rysowania mapy,\nużywając go jako wzoru dla nowych obiektów, które dodasz.\n\n",

Niektóre kraje, takie jak Stany Zjednoczone, Francja\nczy Dania mają w pewnych miejscach dostępne zdjęcia bardzo wysokiej jakości.\n\nZdjęca są czasem przesunięte względem danych na mapie z powodu błędu dostawcy zdjęć. Jeżeli\nwidzisz dużo dróg przesuniętych względem tła, zastanów się zanim jest wszystkie wyrównasz względem\ntła. Zamiast tego może dostosować przesunięcie zdjęć tak, aby zgadzały się z istniejącymi danymi przez\nnaciśnięcie przycisku 'Wyrównaj podkład' na dole Ustawień tła.\n",

Najlepszym źródłem danych adresowych\njest jak zwykle zwiedzanie okolicy  lub własna wiedza - tak jak z każdym innym obiektem, kopiowanie\ndanych z komercyjnych źródeł takich jak Google Maps jest zabronione.\n",

Inspektor wyświetli przyciski dla\npopularnych typów obiektów, a ty możesz znaleźć inne przez wpisanie tego, czego szukasz do pola\nszukania.\n\nKliknij na 'i' w prawym dolnym rogu przycisku typu obiektu, aby dowiedzieć się o nim więcej.\nKliknij na przycisku, aby wybrać ten typ.\n\n### Używanie Formularzy i Edycja tagów\n\nPo wybraniu typu obiektu lub gdy wybierzesz obiekt, który ma już nadany typ, inspektor wyświetli pola\nzawierające szczegóły na temat obiektu, takie jak nazwa i adres.\n\nPoniżej pól, które widzisz, możesz kliknąć na ikony w celu dodania innych szczegółów, jak na przykład\ninformacja z [Wikipedii](http://www.wikipedia.org/), dostęp dla wózków inwalidzkich i innych.\n\nNa dole inspektora kliknij na 'Dodatkowe tagi', aby dodać dowolne inne tagi do elementu.\n[Taginfo](http://taginfo.openstreetmap.org/) jest świetnym źródłem informacji o popularnych\nkombinacjach tagów.\n\nZmiany, które wprowadzisz w inspektorze są automatycznie nanoszone na mapę. Możesz je cofnąć w\nkażdym momencie przez wciśnięcie przycisku 'Cofnij'.\n\n### Zamykanie Inspektora\n\nMożesz zamknąć inspektora przez kliknięcie na przycisk zamknij w górnym prawym rogu, wciśnięcie\nklawisza 'Escape' lub kliknięcie na mapie.\n",

Podświetli to budynek i otworzy małe\nmenu narzędziowe oraz boczny panel pokazujący więcej informacji o budynku.\n\n### Modyfikowanie\n\nCzasami budynki są błędnie umieszczone lub mają błędne tagi.\n\nAby przesunąć cały budynek, zaznacz go, a potem kliknij na narzędzie 'Przesuń'.

Przyjęło się rysowanie budynków w postaci obszarów,\na rysowanie firm, domów czy innej infrastruktury w postaci punktów w obszarze budynku.\n\nZacznij rysować budynek w postaci obszaru przez kliknięcie na przycisku 'Obszar' w górnym lewym\nrogu edytora i zakończ go przez naciśnięcie klawisza 'Enter' na klawiaturze lub przez kliknięcie na\npierwszym rysowanym punkcie w celu zamknięcia obszaru.\n\n### Usuwanie\n\nJeżeli budynek jest całkiem błędny - widzisz, że nie ma go na zdjęciach satelitarnych (a najlepiej\nsprawdziłeś w terenie, że go nie ma) - możesz go usunąć. Bądź ostrożny usuwając obiekty - tak jak po\nkażdej innej modyfikacji, rezultaty są widoczne dla wszystkich, a zdjęcia satelitarne często nie są\naktualne, więc budynek może być po prostu nowo wybudowany.\n\nMożesz usunąć budynek przez kliknięcie na nim, a następnie na ikonie śmietnika lub wciśnięcie\nklawisza 'Delete'.\n"

Bạn có thể cải tiến bản đồ thế giới mở để cho mọi người sử dụng.\n\nCác sửa đổi của bạn trên bản đồ này sẽ xuất hiện cho mọi người dùng OpenStreetMap. Để sửa bản đồ, bạn cần có một [tài khoản OpenStreetMap miễn phí](https://www.openstreetmap.org/user/new).\n\n[Trình vẽ iD](http://ideditor.com/) là một dự án cộng tác.

Khi đối tượng được chọn, bạn sẽ thấy một biểu mẫu ở bên phải chứa các chi tiết về đối tượng, cũng như một trình đơn giống bảng màu của họa sĩ chứa các tác vụ để thực hiện với đối tượng.\n\nCó thể lựa chọn nhiều đối tượng cùng lúc bằng cách nhấn giữ phím Shift và kéo chuột trên bản đồ. Khi kéo chuột, một hộp sẽ xuất hiện và các đối tượng nằm ở trong hộp này sẽ được chọn. Bạn có thể thực hiện một tác vụ với tất cả các đối tượng này cùng lúc.\n\n### Lưu giữ Sửa đổi\n\nKhi bạn sửa đổi các đường sá, tòa nhà, và địa điểm, các thay đổi này được lưu giữ trên máy cho đến khi bạn đăng nó lên máy chủ. Đừng lo nhầm lẫn: chỉ việc nhấn vào các nút Hoàn tác và Làm lại.\n\nNhấn “Lưu” để hoàn thành một tập hợp sửa đổi, thí dụ bạn vừa vẽ xong một khu và muốn bắt đầu vẽ khu mới. Trình vẽ sẽ trình bày các thay đổi để bạn xem lại, cũng như các gợi ý và cảnh báo nếu bạn đã sửa nhầm lẫn.\n\nNếu các thay đổi đều đâu vào đấy, bạn sẽ nhập lời tóm lược các thay đổi và nhấn “Lưu” lần nữa để đăng các thay đổi lên [OpenStreetMap.org](http://www.openstreetmap.org/). Các thay đổi sẽ xuất hiện tại trang đó để mọi người xem và cải tiến.\n\nNếu bạn chưa xong mà cần rời khỏi máy tính, bạn có thể đóng trình vẽ này không sao.

Con đường sẽ được tô sáng, một trình đơn giống bảng màu của họa sĩ sẽ xuất hiện gần con trỏ, và thanh bên sẽ trình bày các chi tiết về con đường.\n\n### Sửa đổi\n\nNhiều khi bạn sẽ gặp những con đường bị chệch đối với hình nền hoặc tuyến đường GPS. Bạn có thể chỉnh lại các con đường này để chính xác hơn.\n\nTrước tiên, nhấn vào con đường cần chỉnh lại. Đường sẽ được tô sáng và các nốt sẽ xuất hiện để bạn kéo sang vị trí đúng hơn. Để thêm chi tiết, nhấn đúp vào một khúc đường chưa có nốt, và một nốt mới sẽ xuất hiện để bạn kéo.\n\nNếu con đường nối với đường khác trên thực tiếp, nhưng trên bản đồ thì chưa nối liền, hãy kéo một nốt của một con đường sang đường kia để nối liền hai con đường. Nối liền các đường tại giao lộ là một điều rất quan trọng tăng khả năng chỉ đường.\n\nĐể di chuyển toàn bộ con đường cùng lúc, nhấn vào công cụ “Di chuyển” hoặc nhấn phím tắt `M`, chuyển con trỏ sang vị trí mới, rồi nhấn chuột để hoàn thành việc di chuyển.\n\n### Xóa\n\nHãy tưởng tượng bạn gặp một con đường hoàn toàn sai: bạn không thấy được con đường trong hình ảnh trên không và, theo lý tưởng, cũng đã ghé vào chỗ đó để xác nhận rằng nó không tồn tại. Nếu trường hợp này, bạn có thể xóa con đường hoàn toàn khỏi bản đồ. Xin cẩn thận khi xóa đối tượng: giống như mọi sửa đổi khác, mọi người sẽ thấy được kết quả. Ngoài ra, hình ảnh trên không nhiều khi lỗi thời – có thể mới xây con đường – thành thử tốt nhất là ghé vào chỗ đó để quan sát chắc chắn, nếu có thể.\n\nĐể xóa một con đường, lựa chọn nó bằng cách nhấn vào nó, rồi nhấn vào hình thùng rác hoặc nhấn phím Delete.\n\n### Tạo mới\n\nBạn có tìm ra một con đường chưa được vẽ trên bản đồ? Hãy bắt đầu vẽ đường kẻ mới bằng cách nhấn vào nút “Đường” ở phía trên bên trái của trình vẽ, hoặc nhấn phím tắt `2`.\n\nNhấn vào bản đồ tại điểm bắt đầu của con đường. Hoặc nếu con đường chia ra từ đường khác đã tồn tại, trước tiên nhấn chuột tại giao lộ giữa hai con đường này.\n\nSau đó, nhấn chuột lần lượt theo lối đường dùng hình ảnh trên không hoặc tuyến đường GPS. Khi nào con đường giao với đường khác, nhấn chuột tại giao lộ để nối liền hai con đường này. Sau khi vẽ xong, nhấn đúp vào nốt cuối dùng hoặc nhấn phím Return hay Enter.\n",

Trình vẽ này hỗ trợ các tuyến đường địa phương, tức tập tin `.gpx` trên máy tính của bạn. Bạn có thể thu loại tuyến đường GPS này dùng một ứng dụng điện thoại thông minh hoặc máy thu GPS.\n\nĐọc về cách khảo sát bằng GPS trong “[Surveying with a GPS](http://learnosm.org/en/beginner/using-gps/)”.\n\nĐể sử dụng một tuyến đường GPX trong việc vẽ bản đồ, kéo thả tập tin GPX vào trình vẽ bản đồ này. Nếu trình vẽ nhận ra tuyến đường, tuyến đường sẽ được tô màu xanh nõn chuối trên bản đồ. Mở hộp “Tùy chọn Hình nền” ở thanh công cụ bên trái để bật tắt hoặc thu phóng lớp GPX này.\n\nTuyến đường GPX không được tải lên OpenStreetMap trực tiếp.

Ngoài ra có hình ảnh rất rõ tại nhiều vùng ở một số quốc gia như Hoa Kỳ, Pháp, và Đan Mạch.\n\nHình ảnh đôi khi bị chệch đối với dữ liệu bản đồ vì dịch vụ hình ảnh có lỗi. Nếu bạn nhận thấy nhiều con đường bị chệch đối với hình nền, xin đừng di chuyển các đường này để trùng hợp với hình ảnh.
