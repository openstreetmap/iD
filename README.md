# iD - friendly JavaScript editor for [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/)

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/openstreetmap/iD.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/openstreetmap/iD)


:warning: _The [`master`](https://github.com/openstreetmap/iD/tree/master) branch is undergoing significant breaking changes for v3 over the next few months. [`2.x`](https://github.com/openstreetmap/iD/tree/2.x) is considerably more stable and is currently the recommended branch for downstream development._

[Watch the video](https://2019.stateofthemap.us/program/sat/id-v3.html) from our talk at State of the Map US 2019 to learn more about the current status of iD and our goals for v3.


## Basics

* iD is a JavaScript [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) editor.
* It's intentionally simple. It lets you do the most basic tasks while
  not breaking other people's data.
* It supports all popular modern desktop browsers: Chrome, Firefox, Safari,
  Opera, Edge, and IE11.
* iD is not yet designed for mobile browsers, but this is something we hope to add!
* Data is rendered with [d3.js](https://d3js.org/).

## Prerequisites

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) version 10 or newer
* [`git`](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/install-git/) for your platform
  * Note for Windows users:
    * Edit `$HOME\.gitconfig`:<br/>
      Add these lines to avoid checking in files with CRLF newlines<br><pre>
      [core]
          autocrlf = input</pre>

## Installation

Note: Windows users should run these steps in a shell started with "Run as administrator".
This is only necessary the first time so that the build process can create symbolic links.

To run the current development version of iD on your own computer:

#### Cloning the repository

The repository is reasonably large, and it's unlikely that you need the full history (~200 MB). If you are happy to wait for it all to download, run:

```
git clone https://github.com/openstreetmap/iD.git
```

To clone only the most recent version, instead use a 'shallow clone':

```
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/openstreetmap/iD.git
```

If you want to add in the full history later on, perhaps to run `git blame` or `git log`, run `git fetch --depth=1000000`

#### Building iD

1. `cd` into the newly cloned project folder
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm run all`
3. Run `npm start`
4. Open `http://localhost:8080/` in a web browser

development, see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).
