# iD - friendly JavaScript editor for [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/)

[![build](https://github.com/openstreetmap/iD/workflows/build/badge.svg)](https://github.com/openstreetmap/iD/actions?query=workflow%3A%22build%22)

## Basics

* iD is a JavaScript [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) editor.
* It's intentionally simple. It lets you do the most basic tasks while not breaking other people's data.
* It supports all popular modern desktop browsers: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Opera, and Edge.
* iD is not yet designed for mobile browsers, but this is something we hope to add!
* Data is rendered with [d3.js](https://d3js.org/).

## Installation

To run the current development version of iD on your own computer:

#### Cloning the repository

The repository is reasonably large, and it's unlikely that you need the full history (~200 MB). If you are happy to wait for it all to download, run:

```
git clone https://github.com/openstreetmap/iD.git
```

To clone only the most recent version, instead use a 'shallow clone':

```
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/openstreetmap/iD.git
```

If you want to add in the full history later on, perhaps to run `git blame` or `git log`, run `git fetch --depth=1000000`

#### Building iD

1. `cd` into the newly cloned project folder
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm run all`
3. Run `npm start`
4. Open `http://127.0.0.1:8080/` in a web browser

For guidance on building a packaged version, running tests, and contributing to
development, see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).
