# iD - friendly JavaScript editor for [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/)

[![build](https://github.com/openstreetmap/iD/workflows/build/badge.svg)](https://github.com/openstreetmap/iD/actions?query=workflow%3A%22build%22)

## Basics

* iD is a JavaScript [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) editor.
* It's intentionally simple. It lets you do the most basic tasks while not breaking other people's data.
* It supports all popular modern desktop browsers: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Opera, and Edge.
* Data is rendered with [d3.js](https://d3js.org/).
