iD is a project to develop a new, friendly editor for [OpenStreetMap](http://www.openstreetmap.org/).
It's designed to offer newcomers an easy way into editing OSM. It's intended to
complement existing editing software, a simple editor to lead into Potlatch and
JOSM. Why should Google Map Maker have all the fun?
