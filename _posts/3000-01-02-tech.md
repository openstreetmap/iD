We're building iD in pure Javascript, using
[d3.js](http://d3js.org/) and SVG for map display. It's a clean codebase
with modular and reusable implementations of editing, authentication,
and user interaction functionality.

[Read the developer notes](https://github.com/systemed/iD/blob/master/NOTES.md) for more details.
