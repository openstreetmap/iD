DrawWay to do:
* start from a POI node ("convert into way?")
* still allow dragging the map

Drag and drop to do:
* presentation
* cope with dragging onto anything, not just blank areas of the map

Next to do:
* drag nodes
* remove trailing commas (for IE!)

Renderer to do
* hover!
* NodeUI renderer needs a default width/height so that clicking a POI without them still shows the highlight
* Fix 'special values' in RuleSet - they're not really special for SVG etc.
* Labels other than text-on-path
* Node headings (for locks etc.)
* Dragging needs tolerance (i.e. less than n pixels and n seconds)

ControllerStates to do:
* Try to share as much code as possible
* Draw way controller states:
	- NoSelection (next click starts, or selects)
	- SelectedWay (next click starts, or selects)
	- SelectedPOINode (next click starts, or selects)
	- DrawWay (next click continues, or completes and edits)

Events
* EntityMouseEvent seems to get called twice most of the time when moving the mouse around in DrawWay
* Maybe we should just broadcast to the Controller, and the Controller knows what to do. In other words:
	- undo says "the following entities have changed: way 5, node 3, way 7, relation 8"
	- the Controller gets the message and invokes a redraw
	- no need for anything else to listen

------------------------------------------------

Modes:
1. Add point
2. Add street or shape
3. Edit object
	3a. edit tags (and relation memberships, etc.)
	3b. move object
	3c. delete object
	3d. extend way
	3e. geometry operations (like P2 Toolbox)

In 'edit': double-clicking goes into "draw shape"; double-clicking then Enter creates POI

Needs greyed-out "step-by-step" window for draw modes:
	Click at the start point to begin drawing
	Add each point, click by click
	Double-click when you've finished
	Then choose what it is

With buttons at the bottom:
	Finish
	Cancel
	Undo last
