In order to make an edit, you'll need to\n[log in](https://www.openstreetmap.org/login).\n\nThe [iD editor](http://ideditor.com/) is a collaborative project with [source\ncode available on GitHub](https://github.com/openstreetmap/iD).\n",

This will highlight the selected feature, open a panel with\ndetails about it, and show a menu of things you can do with the feature.\n\nTo select multiple features, hold down the 'Shift' key. Then either click\non the features you want to select, or drag on the map to draw a rectangle.\nThis will draw a box and select all the points within it.\n\n### Saving Edits\n\nWhen you make changes like editing roads, buildings, and places, these are\nstored locally until you save them to the server. Don't worry if you make\na mistake - you can undo changes by clicking the undo button, and redo\nchanges by clicking the redo button.\n\nClick 'Save' to finish a group of edits - for instance, if you've completed\nan area of town and would like to start on a new area. You'll have a chance\nto review what you've done, and the editor supplies helpful suggestions\nand warnings if something doesn't seem right about the changes.\n\nIf everything looks good, you can enter a short comment explaining the change\nyou made, and click 'Save' again to post the changes\nto [OpenStreetMap.org](http://www.openstreetmap.org/), where they are visible\nto all other users and available for others to build and improve upon.\n\nIf you can't finish your edits in one sitting, you can leave the editor\nwindow and come back (on the same browser and computer), and the\neditor application will offer to restore your work.\n\n### Using the editor\n\nA list of available keyboard shortcuts can be found [here](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/ID/Shortcuts).\n",

An outline should become visible, along\nwith a small tools menu on the map and a sidebar showing more information\nabout the road.\n\n### Modifying\n\nOften you'll see roads that aren't aligned to the imagery behind them\nor to a GPS track. You can adjust these roads so they are in the correct\nplace.\n\nFirst click on the road you want to change. This will highlight it and show\ncontrol points along it that you can drag to better locations. If\nyou want to add new control points for more detail, double-click a part\nof the road without a node, and one will be added.\n\nIf the road connects to another road, but doesn't properly connect on\nthe map, you can drag one of its control points onto the other road in\norder to join them. Having roads connect is important for the map\nand essential for providing driving directions.\n\nYou can also click the 'Move' tool or press the `M` shortcut key to move the entire road at\none time, and then click again to save that movement.\n\n### Deleting\n\nIf a road is entirely incorrect - you can see that it doesn't exist in satellite\nimagery and ideally have confirmed locally that it's not present - you can delete\nit, which removes it from the map. Be cautious when deleting features -\nlike any other edit, the results are seen by everyone and satellite imagery\nis often out of date, so the road could simply be newly built.\n\nYou can delete a road by clicking on it to select it, then clicking the\ntrash can icon or pressing the 'Delete' key.\n\n### Creating\n\nFound somewhere there should be a road but there isn't? Click the 'Line'\nicon in the top-left of the editor or press the shortcut key `2` to start drawing\na line.\n\nClick on the start of the road on the map to start drawing. If the road\nbranches off from an existing road, start by clicking on the place where they connect.\n\nThen click on points along the road so that it follows the right path, according\nto satellite imagery or GPS. If the road you are drawing crosses another road, connect\nit by clicking on the intersection point. When you're done drawing, double-click\nor press 'Return' or 'Enter' on your keyboard.\n",

Some countries, like the United Kingdom, United\nStates, France, and Denmark have very high-quality imagery available for some areas.\n\nImagery is sometimes offset from the map data because of a mistake on the\nimagery provider's side. If you see a lot of roads shifted from the background,\ndon't immediately move them all to match the background. Instead you can adjust\nthe imagery so that it matches the existing data by clicking 'Fix alignment' at\nthe bottom of the Background Settings UI.\n",
            "addresses": "# Addresses\n\nAddresses are some of the most useful information for the map.\n\nAlthough addresses are often represented as parts of streets, in OpenStreetMap\nthey're recorded as attributes of buildings and places along streets.\n\nYou can add address information to places mapped as building outlines\nas well as those mapped as single points. The optimal source of address\ndata is from an on-the-ground survey or personal knowledge - as with any\nother feature, copying from commercial sources like Google Maps is strictly\nforbidden.\n",

Click a button to choose that type.\n\n### Using Forms and Editing Tags\n\nAfter you choose a feature type, or when you select a feature that already\nhas a type assigned, the inspector will display fields with details about\nthe feature like its name and address.\n\nBelow the fields you see, you can click the 'Add field' dropdown to add\nother details, like a Wikipedia link, wheelchair access, and more.\n\nAt the bottom of the inspector, click 'Additional tags' to add arbitrary\nother tags to the element.

Move your\nmouse to shift the building, and click when it's correctly placed.\n\nTo fix the specific shape of a building, click and drag the nodes that form\nits border into better places.\n\n### Creating\n\nOne of the main questions around adding buildings to the map is that\nOpenStreetMap records buildings both as shapes and points. The rule of thumb\nis to _map a building as a shape whenever possible_, and map companies, homes,\namenities, and other things that operate out of buildings as points placed\nwithin the building shape.\n\nStart drawing a building as a shape by clicking the 'Area' button in the top\nleft of the interface, and end it either by pressing 'Return' on your keyboard\nor clicking on the first node drawn to close the shape.\n\n### Deleting\n\nIf a building is entirely incorrect - you can see that it doesn't exist in satellite\nimagery and ideally have confirmed locally that it's not present - you can delete\nit, which removes it from the map.

            "relations": "# Relations\n\nA relation is a special type of feature in OpenStreetMap that groups together\nother features. For example, two common types of relations are *route relations*,\nwhich group together sections of road that belong to a specific freeway or\nhighway, and *multipolygons*, which group together several lines that define\na complex area (one with several pieces or holes in it like a donut).\n\nThe group of features in a relation are called *members*. In the sidebar, you can\nsee which relations a feature is a member of, and click on a relation there\nto select the it. When the relation is selected, you can see all of its\nmembers listed in the sidebar and highlighted on the map.\n\nFor the most part, iD will take care of maintaining relations automatically\nwhile you edit. The main thing you should be aware of is that if you delete a\nsection of road to redraw it more accurately, you should make sure that the\nnew section is a member of the same relations as the original.\n\n## Editing Relations\n\nIf you want to edit relations, here are the basics.\n\nTo add a feature to a relation, select the feature, click the \"+\" button in the\n\"All relations\" section of the sidebar, and select or type the name of the relation.\n\nTo create a new relation, select the first feature that should be a member,\nclick the \"+\" button in the \"All relations\" section, and select \"New relation...\".\n\nTo remove a feature from a relation, select the feature and click the trash\nbutton next to the relation you want to remove it from.\n\nYou can create multipolygons with holes using the \"Merge\" tool. Draw two areas (inner\nand outer), hold the Shift key and click on each of them to select them both, and then\nclick the \"Merge\" (+) button.\n"
