The outer features define the outer edges of the multipolygon, and the inner features define sub-areas or holes cut out from the inside of the multipolygon.","multipolygon_merge":"Merging several lines or areas will create a new multipolygon relation with all selected areas as members. iD will choose the inner and outer roles automatically, based on which features are contained inside other features.","turn_restriction_h":"Turn restrictions","turn_restriction":"A *turn restriction* relation is a group of several road segments in an intersection.
