* :card_index_dividers: **Multiselection editing** has been supercharged, so you can update many features together instead of one at a time.<br/>
_<kbd>â§ Shift</kbd> + click to select multiple features. On touchscreens, tap-and-hold one feature, then tap others to select them too._
* :ballot_box_with_check: **[Osmose](http://osmose.openstreetmap.fr)** data quality issues can now be browsed and resolved within iD. Thanks, [@kymckay], for this integration!<br/>
_Press <kbd>F</kbd> to open the Map Data pane and toggle on Osmose Issues under Data Layers._

[@kymckay]: https://github.com/kymckay

#### :boom: Breaking Changes
* Pressing <kbd>Space</kbd> with features selected no longer opens the edit menu, since the spacebar can now be used to select and deselect things. You can use the [menu key](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menu_key) instead, or hold down <kbd>Space</kbd> with the cursor hovering over a feature
* :warning: There are numerous under-the-hood code changes. See the **Development** section below for details

# 2.15.0
##### 2019-May-21

#### :mega: Release Highlights
* :wrench: We've made a lot of improvements to iD's validator!  It's a lot faster than before,
and can now optionally validate everything downloaded OpenStreetMap.  We have added rules for validating highway
connectivity, outdated tags, very close nodes, and nonsquare buildings.<br/>
_Open the Issues pane to see what the new validator can do! (shortcut <kbd>I</kbd>)_
* :triangular_ruler: Squaring used to be just for closed lines, but now the squaring
tool can be used to square unclosed lines and individual corners.  **Importantly, we've changed the keyboard shortcut from
<kbd>S</kbd> to <kbd>Q</kbd>.**  This is because lines can be both straightened or squared now,
and <kbd>Q</kbd> matches the shortcut used by the JOSM editor.<br/>
_Try squaring some lines, or corner nodes (but remember, the shortcut is now <kbd>Q</kbd>:exclamation:)_
* :straight_ruler: Straightening used to be just for unclosed lines, but now the straightening
tool can be used on sub-sections of lines, on multiple connected lines, and on individual points.<br/>
_Try straightening points to make them line up perfectly (keyboard shortcut <kbd>S</kbd>)_
* :ok_hand: The extraction tool got an upgrade as well.  Before you could detach points from lines, now
the tool is named "extract" and you can extract points from areas too.<br/>
_Try extracting features from areas when they are better mapped as points (keyboard shortcut <kbd>E</kbd>)_
* :memo: We've made the raw tag editor even _raw-er_.  You can now toggle between list and text views when editing
tags.  The text view is especially useful for copying and pasting tags!<br/>
_Click the icons above the "All tags" section to toggle between list and text views._
* :fries: The [name-suggestion-index](http://osmlab.github.io/name-suggestion-index/brands/) project that powers iD's brand search got a big upgrade too!  You can now find more brands than before, and brand logos will appear in the preset search results and in the feature editor.<br/>
_Map all the branded businesses in your town!_


#### :boom: Breaking Changes
- Change the Square shortcut from <kbd>S</kbd> to <kbd>Q</kbd> since lines can now be both straightened and squared
- Merge the generic presets for the `point` and `vertex` geometries
- Removed `utilIdleWorker` and `utilCallWhenIdle` ([#6299])

# 2.12.0
##### 2018-Dec-03

#### :mega: Release Highlights
* :v: Mac users can now use 2 finger trackpad gestures to pan and zoom the map.<br/>
_Try swiping with 2 fingers to pan, or pinching out/in to zoom and unzoom. You'll be less likely to accidentally drag nodes!_
* :small_red_triangle_down: iD now draws triangular markers on the "down" side of ways where the direction matters.  Thanks, Huon Wilson [@huonw] for this feature!</br>
_Ways with a direction include cliffs, coastlines, retaining walls, kerbs, guard rails, embankments._
* :left_right_arrow: You can now resize the sidebar, or hide it completely. Shout out to Quincy Morgan [@quincylvania] for his work on this!</br>
_Try dragging the sidebar to resize it, or click the hide button in the top toolbar. The top bar buttons can also shrink on narrower screens._
* :hamburger: We've released a huge upgrade to the [brand name suggestions](https://github.com/osmlab/name-suggestion-index) in iD. Thank you to [everyone who volunteered](https://github.com/osmlab/name-suggestion-index/issues/2034) to match brand names to their proper OpenStreetMap tags.</br>
_Try adding some branded businesses to the map - `brand`, `brand:wikidata`, and other tags will be set for you._
* :paperclip: More Wikidata integration! iD now displays linked data if a feature has a `wikidata` tag, and will protect fields like `name` and `brand` from direct editing.<br/>
_Make sure prominent features have a Wikidata tag, for added protection against accidental changes._
* :high_brightness: More features for working with relations. Hovering over a relation or member in the sidebar will highlight it on the map. You can also download incomplete sections, and zoom to inspect relation children. Thanks, Quincy Morgan [@quincylvania]!<br/>
_Check out the "All Relations" and "All Members" sections of the sidebar to try out the new relation editing tools._
* :octocat: Hacktoberfest happened!  We merged 40 pull requests during the month of October.  Thank you to all of our new contributors!<br/>

# 2.11.1
##### 2018-Aug-29

#### :bug: Bugfixes
* Fix handling of `.gpx` files passed in via url ([#5253])

[#5253]: https://github.com/openstreetmap/iD/issues/5253


# 2.11.0
##### 2018-Aug-26

#### :mega: Release Highlights
* :1234: We've rolled out support for vector tiles in iD! This work was done as part of [Princi Vershwal's 2018 Google Summer of Code project](https://medium.com/@vershwal/vector-tile-support-for-openstreetmaps-id-editor-40b1cb77f63b). Thanks [@vershwal]!<br/>
_Open the Map Data pane (shortcut <kbd>F</kbd>) and choose "Custom Map Data" to add a vector tile source._
* :trophy: To get ready for [State of the Map US](https://2018.stateofthemap.us/), let's make Detroit, USA the [best mapped city in the world](https://www.openstreetmap.us/2018/07/detroit-mapping-challenge-sotmus2018/)!  iD includes 3 vector tile layers of public data, built by [@jonahadkins], to support the Detroit Mapping Challenge.  More info is available on the [osmus/detroid-mapping-challenge repository](https://github.com/osmus/detroit-mapping-challenge).<br/>
_When mapping around Detroit, try out the special Detroit vector tile layers on the Map Data pane (shortcut <kbd>F</kbd>)_

[@vershwal]: https://github.com/vershwal
[@jonahadkins]: https://github.com/jonahadkins

#### :tada: New Features
* Add support for vector tile data ([#3742], [#5072], [#5243], thanks [@vershwal] and [@geohacker])
  * Replaced the "GPX"/"Local Data" layer with "Custom Map Data" on Map Data pane.
  * We've added several vector tile sources to the Map Data pane.  They will be available if the user is editing around Detroit.  This is a "Beta" feature to demonstrate the technology. (thanks [@jonahadkins])
  * :warning: We refactored `svgGpx`->`svgData` module, which now handles both data files and data from vector tile urls. (Important: the URL parameter for loading gpx files has **not** changed, and remains compatible with applications like the HOT Task Manager).
  * Added `serviceVectorTile` for fetching and caching data from vector tile servers, and merging and deduplicating features that cross tile boundaries.

* Show selected note details on the History Panel ([#5158])
* Show location of selected note on the Measurement Panel ([#5158])
* Allow submit note comments with shortcut <kbd>cmd</kbd>+<kbd>enter</kbd> ([#5193])

# 2.0.0
##### 2016-Nov-15

#### :boom: Breaking Changes
* :warning: iD is now written in a modular code style using ES6 `import`/`export` and [rollup.js](http://rollupjs.org/) as a build tool (#3118, #3179, #3180)
  * Many thanks to @tmcw, @kepta, @tyrasd, @beaugunderson, @davidchouse
* :warning: Flattened namespace means that all functions have changed names (#3479)
  * e.g. `iD.actions.Move` -> `iD.actionMove`, `iD.geo.Extent` -> `iD.geoExtent`
  * Many deprecated names are still exported as symbols, e.g. `iD.Context` - we will remove these eventually
* :warning: Customized iD deployments can manipulate live objects, rather than iD.Context accessors
  * No longer need to call things like `presets()`, `imagery()`, `taginfo()` when creating `iD.Context`
  * See [API.md](https://github.com/openstreetmap/iD/blob/develop/API.md#customized-deployments) for details on customized deployments
* :warning: iD has upgraded to the latest released versions of d3, lodash, rbush, etc.
  * d3 no longer adds itself to the global namespace, but can now be accessed via `iD.d3`
* :warning: iD now uses `npm` scripts for all build processes
  * iD requires Node v4 or higher, but does not require `make` anymore
  * Update install instructions and prerequisites (#3466, thanks @tyrasd)
* :warning: iD url hash map order has changed to `zoom/latitude/longitude` to match OSM and others (#3554)
* :warning: Authentication methods like `context.preauth`, `connection.switch`, `iD.uiSourceSwitch.keys` options have changed
  * `url` option has been renamed to `urlroot`

#### :tada: New Features
* `ui()` initializer now accepts a callback that will be called when loadLocale is finished (#3550)
* Vertex keyboard navigation (#1917, #3539)
  * `[` or `pageup` - jump to previous vertex
  * `]` or `pagedown` - jump to next vertex
  * `â[` or `home` - jump to first vertex
  * `â]` or `end` - jump to last vertex
  * `\` or `pause-break` - select next parent, if at intersection
* OSM API calls are now authenticated for logged in users (helps with (#3519, #2262)
