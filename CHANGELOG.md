# 2.6.0
##### January 21, 2018

#### :mega: Release Highlights

* :level_slider: You can now adjust imagery brightness, contrast, saturation, and sharpness. (Not currently available in Internet Explorer or Edge)<br/>
_Try enhancing the background imagery by opening the Background pane (shortcut <kbd>B</kbd>) and
adjusting the slider controls._

* :no_entry_sign: iD will now prevent users from drawing many self-crossing lines and areas. See issue [#4646] for examples and more info. You can override these checks by holding down the <kbd>Alt</kbd>/<kbd>Option</kbd> key while drawing.

* :arrow_up_down: Features with a direction-type tag will display view cones indicating the directions they face. This is useful for mapping features like street signs, traffic signals, billboards, security cameras, and more.

* :tram: Transit-related presets have been updated to support Public Transport v2 tagging schema. Many presets have new icons too, to better match the mode of transport.<br/>
_Try mapping some transit platforms, stations, stop positions, etc._

* :book: We've completely refreshed the in-app Help content in iD. Huge thanks to Manfred Brandl [@manfredbrandl], Minh Nguyễn [@1ec5], and our many volunteers on Transifex for their work on this!<br/>
_Check out the new help texts by opening the Help pane (shortcut <kbd>H</kbd>)._

# 2.0.0
##### Nov 15, 2016

#### :boom: Breaking Changes
* :warning: iD is now written in a modular code style using ES6 `import`/`export` and [rollup.js](http://rollupjs.org/) as a build tool (#3118, #3179, #3180)
  * Many thanks to @tmcw, @kepta, @tyrasd, @beaugunderson, @davidchouse
* :warning: Flattened namespace means that all functions have changed names (#3479)
  * e.g. `iD.actions.Move` -> `iD.actionMove`, `iD.geo.Extent` -> `iD.geoExtent`
  * Many deprecated names are still exported as symbols, e.g. `iD.Context` - we will remove these eventually
* :warning: Customized iD deployments can manipulate live objects, rather than iD.Context accessors
  * No longer need to call things like `presets()`, `imagery()`, `taginfo()` when creating `iD.Context`
  * See [API.md](https://github.com/openstreetmap/iD/blob/master/API.md#customized-deployments) for details on customized deployments
* :warning: iD has upgraded to the latest released versions of d3, lodash, rbush, etc.
  * d3 no longer adds itself to the global namespace, but can now be accessed via `iD.d3`
* :warning: iD now uses `npm` scripts for all build processes
  * iD requires Node v4 or higher, but does not require `make` anymore
  * Update install instructions and prerequisites (#3466, thanks @tyrasd)
* :warning: iD url hash map order has changed to `zoom/latitude/longitude` to match OSM and others (#3554)
* :warning: Authentication methods like `context.preauth`, `connection.switch`, `iD.uiSourceSwitch.keys` options have changed
  * `url` option has been renamed to `urlroot`

#### :tada: New Features

* Vertex keyboard navigation (#1917, #3539)
  * `[` or `pageup` - jump to previous vertex
  * `]` or `pagedown` - jump to next vertex
  * `⌘[` or `home` - jump to first vertex
  * `⌘]` or `end` - jump to last vertex
  * `\` or `pause-break` - select next parent, if at intersection
